Next.js is a popular framework for building server-side rendered React applications. It provides a seamless development experience with features like automatic code splitting, server-side rendering, and hot module replacement.

Key features of Next.js include:

1. Server-side rendering: Next.js allows you to render React components on the server, which improves performance and SEO. It generates static HTML for each page, making it faster to load.

2. Automatic code splitting: Next.js automatically splits your JavaScript code into smaller chunks, which are loaded only when needed. This helps reduce the initial load time of your application.

3. Hot module replacement: Next.js supports hot module replacement, which allows you to update your code without refreshing the entire page. This speeds up the development process and improves productivity.

4. API routes: Next.js provides built-in API routes, allowing you to create serverless functions that can be called from your client-side code. This makes it easy to handle server-side logic without the need for a separate backend.

5. CSS support: Next.js has built-in support for CSS modules, allowing you to write modular and scoped CSS. It also supports popular CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components and emotion.

6. Static site generation: Next.js supports static site generation, where pages are pre-rendered at build time. This is useful for content-heavy websites that don't require real-time data.

Overall, Next.js is a powerful framework that simplifies the development of server-side rendered React applications. It combines the best of both worlds by providing a great developer experience and excellent performance.
